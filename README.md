## Lock
# Lock is a graphical register and login system in python with use of Tkinter. 

- This is a learning project of mine. I am searching for help in the internet every now and then, but there isnÂ´t any copy & paste here.
- Lock is still under construction.
- You may recognize the Flow-Chart - it is the preliminary roadmap for this project too.
